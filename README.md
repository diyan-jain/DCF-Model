# DCF Valuation Model
Hello! I'm Diyan Jain. Here's a brief desciption about this model I created.

I created a DCF(Discounted Cash Flow) based financial model on MS Excel to calcualte the value of a listed company to its per share value using WACC, intrinsic growth rate and DCF calculations. The model is highly accurate and can be used to make investment decisions based on knowing whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued presently.
